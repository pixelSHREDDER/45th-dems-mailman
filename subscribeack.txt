Greetings, and welcome to the %(real_name)s@45thdemocrats.org mailing list! %(welcome)s

Below you'll find some important info about how our organization's mailing lists work, and what features you have as a subscriber. Let's get started!

***ABOUT THIS LIST***

To send a message to all the subscribers of this list, email %(real_name)s@45thdemocrats.org.

***HOW DO OUR LISTS WORK?***

For the most part, our mailing lists serve two purposes:
    - Allow our members / the public to easily send a message to an entire group/committee/board at once, and
    - Allow members of a group/committee/board to easily communicate amongst themselves using a single email address

In some cases, though, a mailing list may be used to provide a board member with an email address with the appropriate title and branding (i.e. mytitle@45thdemocrats.org), which forwards messages to their preferred personal email address (a mailing list of one!).

In addition to regular subscribers, at least one subscriber in each list is also an Admin- usually the highest ranking member(s) of the group. For example, if the list is for a committee, the committee chair will usually be an Admin. Admins have the ability to perform more advanced list management tasks, and are in charge of approving or rejecting new subscriber requests.

As a failsafe measure, the Tech Committee Chair also holds Admin permissions for every list. So if you run into any trouble with a list you can always message the Tech Committee at technology@45thdemocrats.org for help.
